// S-00H TK-001: the standalone Task record.
//
// A Task record is its own `TASK.md`, one directory per Task beneath its
// owning Spec's directory (`<specDir>/tasks/<id>/TASK.md`), so a later
// retirement move (ADR-000I) relocates the Task's own folder without
// touching the Spec's stable declared path. This module only reads that
// record; it changes nothing about how `next`, `claim`, `close`, `render` or
// `doctor` behave against the embedded slice table in
// `workbench/tools/spec-workbench.mjs`; TK-002 migrated those
// commands, reading this module rather than changing it. A room may carry both an embedded
// table row and a standalone Task record for the same identifier; nothing
// here counts or cross-checks the two, so no reader doubles a total. TK-002
// since gave a Spec one source of slice truth at the command seam: a Spec
// with a `tasks/` directory is record-backed and its retained table is
// completed history, so the commands refuse that coexistence rather than
// read past it. This reader is still the plain record reader and enforces
// none of that.
//
// `listTaskRecords` scans exactly one directory level beneath `tasks/`:
// `<specDir>/tasks/<id>/TASK.md`. S-00I TK-004 gave the lifecycle folder that
// comment once deferred a real reader: `listRetiredTaskRecords` scans
// `<specDir>/tasks/retired/<id>/TASK.md` (ADR-000I's `TASK_LIFECYCLE_FOLDERS`)
// as the explicit historical route, while `listTaskRecords` itself still
// scans only the top level and now skips a lifecycle-folder entry there
// instead of reading it as a Task directory.
//
// TT-Q10 (the new-identifier form) is settled: Task identifiers keep the
// existing `TK-###` form (LEXICON and the grilling destination ledger), and
// this reader introduces no other prefix.
