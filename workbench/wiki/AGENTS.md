# Command Information Center Wiki Agent Instructions

> Generated from LLM Workbench v3.2.1.

This lane is the durable, human-editable knowledge base for this project. The
root `AGENTS.md` governs how agents work; this file only bounds wiki
maintenance.

## Cold Start And Navigation

1. Read `MEMORY.md`.
2. Follow one directly relevant link.
3. For current project state, leave the wiki and read the root controls.
4. Search only when the router is incomplete or during explicit maintenance.

## Authority And Scope

- The wiki owns durable documentary knowledge and navigation, not a
  Governance Plane and not authorization.
- Verified runtime and the root controls outrank wiki notes; maintained active
  notes outrank `archive/` and platform auto-memory.
- Raw sources stay read-only during wiki maintenance unless the user also
  requests project or source work.
- Do not read or reproduce `restricted` context unless the task requires it.

## CRUD

- Follow `SCHEMA.md` for properties, provenance, sensitivity, and freshness.
- Update an existing owning note before creating another.
- Keep collections flat; never copy live task state.
- Any agent creates or updates a Design Concept article its operation touched;
  record the authorizing operation in `authorized_by` and `History`. Repair
  from direct proof or mark stale; see `SCHEMA.md` Create and Update.
- Reading and updating the Wiki is part of every use: ingest follows `SCHEMA.md`
  Update, and the lint of touched pages and of the whole Wiki follows `SCHEMA.md`
  Lint and the Runbook's Wiki Lint section.
- Run `node workbench/tools/wiki.mjs validate` after maintained-note changes.

## Documentation

When a durable change alters project, person, machine, or navigation truth,
update the owning note in the same task. Otherwise say
`Docs checked; no update needed` and name why.
