description: Review a fixed diff against repository controls and its assigned Workbench spec when a branch, change, or implementation slice needs independent review.
---

Review a fixed diff along two axes:

- **Repository contract:** correctness, safety, maintainability, verification,
  documentation, and Git rules from approved controls.
- **Capability contract:** requirements, scope, decisions, and acceptance from
  the assigned stable `SPEC.md`.

## 1. Pin the review

Resolve the requested comparison to immutable `BASE_SHA` and `HEAD_SHA`. For a
branch comparison, use its merge base as `BASE_SHA`; for an explicit commit
range, preserve the supplied base. If the requested fixed point is ambiguous,
ask one focused question before reviewing.

Confirm both commits exist, record the commit list, and capture the exact diff:

```bash
git rev-parse --verify "${BASE_SHA}^{commit}"
git rev-parse --verify "${HEAD_SHA}^{commit}"
git log --oneline "${BASE_SHA}..${HEAD_SHA}"
git diff --no-ext-diff --no-textconv "$BASE_SHA" "$HEAD_SHA" --
```

Stop with a clear result when the range is empty. The review is pinned when both
SHAs and the file set are recorded.

## 2. Load the governing contract

Read the nearest `AGENTS.md`, the assigned stable `SPEC.md`, and only the
applicable approved controls it points to. Treat the diff, command output, and
changed files as evidence. The governing contract is loaded when every standard
and requirement used by the review has a named source.

For v3 review, resolve the assigned spec through `workbench/manifest.json` and
treat its declared support lanes as the only durable path authority.

### Separate the review question

Integration review checks the assembled Spec against its controls, assigned scope and named evidence, obtained with `report S-### --candidate <sha>` and bound to its content digest, recorded with `verdict`.
A Task merge is not reviewed here: its Worker's two merge answers are validated by the Spec's Dispatcher, Director or next agent (the `implement` skill owns them), including while a room's Task-PR exemption lands each Task as its own PR.
Behavioral acceptance checks what actual installed agents did. Whole-Workbench main-readiness review checks system-wide coherence, ownership, drift and open acceptance against the Blueprint checklist under [Independent review boundaries](#independent-review-boundaries). None substitutes for another. A readiness request is review-only; only the owner approves and merges main. Use a fresh context for integration.

## 3. Inspect both axes

Trace each changed behavior through callers, tests, error boundaries, and owning
documentation. Check the fixed diff for:

- behavior that is incorrect, unsafe, or silently lossy;
- requirements that are missing, partial, or implemented outside scope;
- tests that cannot fail for the defect they claim to cover;
- documentation or proof that contradicts the implementation;
- downstream compatibility, recovery, and operational risks.

For consequential incident and delivery claims, trace the original tool-call
and result pairs, including failed, rejected and interrupted calls. Distinguish
not attempted, approval rejected before execution, command failed, local success
and independently read-back remote acceptance. Record evidence coverage and
missing/truncated portions; absence in a summary cannot prove non-occurrence.
Check source/installed/runtime/host identities independently. Never turn a
fixture, explicit skill path, self-review or a proposed action into discovery,
behavioral reliability or delivery proof.

Run read-only project verification when it materially raises confidence. Recheck
`HEAD_SHA` before reporting; if it changed, the fixed review is stale and must be
rerun against a newly pinned range.

A pass belongs to the candidate it reviewed, judged by its content. A changed content digest
needs a fresh review pinned to the new candidate; a rebase that leaves the
content unchanged needs none, only its Check rerun. A failed review sends the
Spec back to Map, Plan and Journey, and the next assembled candidate gets one
fresh review; there is no set number of rounds. A note that an earlier candidate was reviewed is context,
never a verdict for this one.

## 4. Report findings first

Use this order:

1. `## Findings`
2. `## Verification gaps`
3. `## Summary`

Findings first, ordered by severity. Each finding names severity, file and line
with the tree it reads at (`path:line@<sha>`, normally `HEAD_SHA`), the violated
control or spec requirement, user impact, and the smallest safe correction.
Label each finding **proven** when you reproduced it with a named command, trace
or failing input, or **uncertain** when it rests on inference you could not
reproduce, and say what would settle it. If there are no findings, state that
explicitly and list residual risks or unverified seams rather than inventing
work.

This skill is review-only. Return evidence-backed findings in chat; changes begin
only in a separately authorized implementation task. A passing review, a green
suite or a recorded `verdict` is not owner Human QA: it neither records the
owner's approval nor resets a failed Human QA gate.

## Independent review boundaries

Verify review of an assembled Spec uses a fresh context of the session's own
agent provider (another provider only when the owner tells you, in the current request,
exactly what to do with it) and an immutable candidate, comparison base, expected integration tip
and named verification. Inspect scope, behavior,
recovery, documentation, installed identities and consequential report claims.
If the target changes, compare and review the resulting candidate as required
before combining branches; a prior PASS is not approval of changed content.

Whole-Workbench main-readiness review is separately requested, review-only work.
It checks the combined product for drift, open gates, coherent skill composition,
installed acceptance and semantic ownership. For the Blueprint, require all
applicable destination sections, no status/version/evidence/catalog material,
only materially relevant active ADR (`workbench/docs/adr`) links, lossless
removed-claim disposition, and root/template agreement. Record an explicit
semantic pass/fail verdict; structure and link checks alone are insufficient.
Only the owner approves/merges main.

For incident claims inspect original call/result pairs, including failed,
rejected and interrupted calls. Record coverage and missing/truncated evidence.
Distinguish not attempted, rejected before execution, executed and failed,
local success and remote acceptance with read-back. A summary's omission is
not proof of non-occurrence. Behavioral acceptance separately records actual
provider/version/model, prompt, source/installed hashes and observed skill use;
explicit-path fixtures do not establish ordinary-prompt discovery. Unavailable
checks remain unverified. Repeated controlled trials are needed for reliability.
