# Update Harness

Migrate one existing project to the current canonical LLM Workbench contract.
Reconcile; do not overwrite. The target project's verified truth survives the
template change.

## Invocation

Use `/update-harness [project path]`. If the path is omitted, use the current
repository. Treat an explicitly requested version as the target only after the
canonical source confirms it exists.

Locate the checked-out LLM Workbench repository that supplies the target
version before reading its templates or lifecycle tooling. This public product
is self-contained and does not require a private machine path or external skill
catalog.

## Route selection

Choose the route before running anything. The migration has two exclusive
modes, and only one of them touches a user-scoped skill:

- `--layout-only` migrates the support root and reads skill presence only. It
  never installs, compares, marks, backs up, or replaces a skill. This is the
  default route for an already-adopted room and for any host whose discovery
  root the tool must not touch.
- `--explicit-update` additionally replaces Workbench-managed skills, and is
  used only when replacing them is the point of the run.

A same-named user-scoped skill whose ownership must remain untouched is a reason
to choose `--layout-only`, not a workstation to reconcile first. The
`skill-path-collision` and `unmanaged-skill` refusals belong to
`--explicit-update` alone; a `--layout-only` run returns before either is
reached. Do not propose inventorying, backing up, or replacing an existing user
skill in order to retry a route you did not need.

## 1. Establish authority and source truth

1. Read the applicable root and project-local `AGENTS.md` files completely.
2. Verify the target repository root, branch, remote, upstream, worktrees, and
   dirty state.
3. Verify the canonical Workbench path, branch, remote, dirty state, and current
   version from its live `README.md` or `BLUEPRINT.md`.
4. Read the canonical `templates/ADOPTION.md`, the current control templates,
   and the upgrade section in the target `RUNBOOK.md` when it exists.

If the active checkout is dirty or belongs to another work lane, preserve it and
create a separate worktree from the target's verified staging/default branch.
Never stash, discard, or absorb unrelated work merely to make the migration
convenient.

Completion criterion: both source and target are verified live, the migration
base is explicit, and no unrelated dirty state is at risk.

## 2. Inventory and baseline

List every file that steers agents or humans, including root controls,
`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, roadmaps/gameplans, policy/checklist files, taskboards,
specs, and harness feedback. Classify each:

- **Port**: project truth that belongs in a current control file or stable spec.
- **Fold**: live rules that should move into the current `AGENTS.md` contract.
- **Keep**: project-local design, research, or operations material the harness
  should reference rather than absorb.
- **Retire**: a competing old control or queue that must become a cold archive.

Run the target's documented full verification suite before editing. Read named
PASS/FAIL markers and test totals; do not trust a zero process code when the tool
can print load or parse errors and still exit zero.

If the baseline cannot be taken at all - the suite cannot run for a reason this
change did not cause and cannot repair - record it in the owning spec's
`**Baseline:**` field as `unavailable` with one reason from the closed set
`host-restricted`, `product-broken-as-found`, or `owner-declined-on-boundary`,
the evidence for that reason, and the statement that the requested change is
not implicated. A reason outside that set is refused. The change then proceeds
against that record, and every later completion criterion compares against the
recorded state instead of a green run and says so. A red baseline is not
unavailable: it still stops unless the owner explicitly expands the task, and
`unavailable` never relabels a failing suite.

Completion criterion: every steering file is classified and a reproducible,
green pre-migration baseline is recorded, or the baseline is recorded
`unavailable` with its reason and evidence. If the baseline is red, record the
existing failure and stop unless the user explicitly expands the task to fix it.

## 3. Reconcile the new ownership model

Compare the target's current harness with the canonical templates. Copy only
the changed contract; preserve filled project-specific scope, Git rules,
verification commands, product boundaries, and safety rules.

Settle the target's starting point first:

- **A v2-root room, whether it was adopted earlier or not**: it has a root
  `specs/` directory and no `workbench/` support root, so it cannot yet declare
  a lane. Run the layout route from the checked-out Workbench against the
  clean, committed target:

  ```bash
  node tools/workbench-upgrade.mjs upgrade \
    --project [ABSOLUTE_PROJECT_PATH] \
    --home [USER_HOME] \
    --version v3.2.1 \
    --layout-only
  ```

  It requires every core skill to be present in a user-scoped discovery root
  and reads that presence only; it migrates the legacy lanes once through the
  Adoption seam, installs the receipt-backed runtime tools, records
  `provenance.lifecycle: upgrade` with the exact source commit, and writes
  `workbench/sessions/recovery/upgrade-recovery.json` with
  `skills: "presence-only"`. It works on a host whose discovery root is a
  foreign Git repository because it never touches one. Only after it completes
  do you reconcile specs through the manifest the route just declared
  (`workbench/manifest.json`). Never rerun Adoption for an already-adopted
  room; a second `adoption` record contradicts its first.
- **A room already on a v3 support root**: never rerun Adoption. Run the
  release checkout's `workbench-layout.mjs migrate --project PATH --version VERSION`
  for additive declared collections. It preserves old note paths and reports
  its exact layout source. Seeded schema/examples retain adjusted room copies.
  Inventory and hash the project-owned controls, product code, active specs,
  completed evidence, and Wiki content before reconciling them through the
  existing manifest. Update only the intended template sections and managed
  components. Run the release checkout's `workbench-tools.mjs update
  --explicit-update` for runtime tools and `workbench-skills.mjs update
  --explicit-update` for the core skills in `workbench/skills`, retain each
  receipt and backup, and compare the project-owned inventory afterward. A
  room stamped before the skills lane existed gets the lane and its
  `.agents/skills` and `.claude/skills` adapters from `workbench-skills.mjs
  install` after the layout migration declares it. The manifest's adoption
  source remains historical; current tool and skill generations belong in
  their receipts. Exercise rollback from the recorded backup when the
  upgrade's recovery proof has not already been established.

For the v3 spec-centered Workbench:

- keep `AGENTS.md` small and operational;
- keep cross-cutting product truth in `BLUEPRINT.md`;
- create stable `workbench/specs/S-###-slug/SPEC.md` capability packets in the
  lane the manifest declares;
- make `TASKBOARD.md` a generated hot projection;
- keep `RUNBOOK.md` an operations index whose rows point to the skills that
  carry each procedure, with the room's own exact commands and recovery;
- keep `CLAUDE.md` as the thin `@AGENTS.md` bridge;
- preserve public setup in `README.md` and harness friction in
  `WORKBENCH_FEEDBACK.md` (legacy `HARNESS_FEEDBACK.md`);
- refresh the Workbench-managed runtime tools in `workbench/tools/` only
  through the release checkout's
  `node tools/workbench-tools.mjs update --project PATH --home HOME --explicit-update`,
  which backs up changed files and records a rollback path; never hand-copy a
  runtime tool;
- refresh the Workbench-managed core skills in `workbench/skills/` only
  through the release checkout's
  `node tools/workbench-skills.mjs update --project PATH --home HOME --explicit-update`,
  which replaces only changed core skills, backs the previous directories up,
  records a rollback path and leaves room-added skills alone; never hand-copy
  a core skill and never touch the provider home to update a room.

A room whose `AGENTS.md` and `RUNBOOK.md` still hold the earlier long shape
reconciles them to the brief and operations index this way:

1. Update the core skills first (`workbench-skills.mjs update --explicit-update`,
   or `install` for a room without the lane). An index row that points to a
   skill the room's lane does not hold binds nothing, and `doctor` reports it
   as `skill-pointer-dangling`, so the new index lands only after the skills it
   points to are in the lane.
2. Bring in the new brief and index from the templates, and keep the room's own
   lines, its own Runbook rows and sections, and every divergence it recorded.
   Never replace a room-owned line silently; a line the room deliberately
   changed is restored or recorded as a decision, as section 5 says.
3. Run the control fidelity report with the room's earlier template
   generation: `--previous-templates PATH`, or nothing when the room manifest's
   recorded source commit is in the release checkout. A line labeled a
   generation difference (`earlier-template`, `newer-template` or
   `template-changed`) is the template's change, reconciled to the new shape;
   an unlabeled `added`, `dropped` or `changed` line is the room's own.
4. A skill the room added to its lane is not pointed to by the shipped index
   and teaches only; pointing a row of the room's own at it is the room's
   decision.

The one-time v2 route, `tools/workbench-upgrade.mjs upgrade --explicit-update`
(or its `--layout-only` mode; the two are exclusive), lays the skills lane and
its adapters down through Adoption's migration and records the pre-migration
Git SHA, inventory and both receipts in the same recovery record; it never
reads, compares or replaces skills in a provider home.

Map capabilities, not every historical task. Create completed specs only for
durable current capabilities whose acceptance and proof are already real. Move
the actual active dependency chain into active/planned specs. Preserve the old
queue and proof ledger in a dated cold archive; never rewrite historical proof
into cleaner claims.

Update `.claude/settings.json` or equivalent mechanical scope enforcement when
new `specs/` or harness-tool paths become writable.

Completion criterion: every live rule and active work item has one owner, old
history remains reachable, and the target has no competing active queue.

## 4. Stamp, render, and diagnose

Stamp every copied control with the verified target version. Remove template
placeholders and stale version/path/routing language. Run the current lifecycle
commands from the target root, normally:

```bash
node workbench/tools/spec-workbench.mjs render
node workbench/tools/spec-workbench.mjs doctor
node workbench/tools/spec-workbench.mjs next --json
```

Inspect the rendered Blueprint catalog and Taskboard projection. Confirm `next`
returns the genuinely eligible active slice or `null` for a real dependency or
owner gate. Do not manipulate status merely to make `next` return work.

Completion criterion: render is deterministic, doctor is green, links resolve,
spec paths are stable, and selection matches the project's real gate.

### Workbench self-drift boundary

The target project's drift check is not the canonical Workbench's self-drift
check. Whenever the source Workbench itself is being changed or updated, run a
read-only self-drift review before and after the source change. Inspect the
source controls, Specs and projections, manifest, ADR/Wiki routes, update and
review procedures, templates, managed tools/skills and receipts, seeded
artifacts, and readable continuity metadata. Reconcile current-facing statuses,
blockers, versions, paths, owners and latest events against their owners.

A passing target-project check, render, doctor or test suite does not establish
semantic freshness. If a current-facing artifact still presents completed work
as pending, carries a resolved blocker, points at a retired route, or has stale
version/provenance information that could misroute a cold-start agent, the
Workbench update is not complete. In the source checkout located in step 1,
run `node workbench/tools/self-drift.mjs --phase pre --json` before the change
and `--phase post --json` afterward. Record both receipts and the bounded
manual semantic check with its unresolved findings; no-machine-finding output
is not a clean-update verdict. Preserve
explicit historical and append-only evidence.

## 5. Re-verify and prove the migration

Run the same full project suite as the baseline, plus harness-specific checks:

- the canonical Workbench evaluator when available, recorded as a diagnostic
  rather than product-outcome proof;
- canonical tool byte comparison when copied;
- for an already-v3 room, a before/after byte inventory proving that controls,
  product code, active work, completed evidence, and Wiki content changed only
  where the owning upgrade spec intended, plus the managed-tool receipt and
  backup or an exercised rollback;
- placeholder and stale-version search;
- retired control-name and duplicate-queue search;
- control-file stamps and mechanical scope alignment;
- diff review for lost project-specific rules or accidental product changes,
  backed by the control fidelity report run from the release checkout:

  ```bash
  node tools/control-fidelity.mjs report --project /absolute/project
  ```

  Every `dropped` or `changed` line it lists for `AGENTS.md` is either restored
  or recorded as a decision in the upgrade spec or an ADR under
  `workbench/docs/adr/`, except a line labeled a generation difference, which
  is the template's own change and is reconciled to the current shape; the
  report labels a checkout-versus-manifest version mismatch and never blocks.
- feedback harvest: append observed harness friction to the manifest-declared
  feedback lane, or record `none observed` with the reason in the upgrade spec.

Record evaluator score and missing-evidence diagnostics, but do not pad the
control plane merely to satisfy keyword heuristics. Native behavior proof,
doctor, and truthful selection state remain the completion gates.

Record the upgrade in a dedicated stable spec. Close it only when its acceptance
criteria, proof, documentation impact, and completion result are complete. Then
render and doctor again so the completed migration leaves the hot board.

Completion criterion: project results match or improve on baseline - or, where
the baseline was recorded `unavailable`, the result compares against that record
and says so instead of implying a green baseline was taken - harness checks are
green, and the migration spec contains the exact evidence.

## 6. Publish through the target's workflow

Review the final diff and status. Follow the target's branch and integration
rules. When authorized by those controls, commit and push the migration branch;
open the normal review PR into its staging/default branch. Never promote to an
owner-only final branch or merge a review-held PR without explicit approval.

Report:

1. What changed.
2. Why it changed.
3. Risks or side effects.
4. Pre/post verification and lifecycle results.
5. Branch, commit, push, and PR state.
6. The exact remaining owner gate, if any.

Completion criterion: the verified migration is recoverable remotely or the
specific publication blocker is stated without claiming completion. The
update is `done` only when both boxes hold:

- [ ] The upgrade exists as a commit on a prefixed task branch pushed to the
      default remote; migration output left untracked is `in-progress`, not
      `done`.
- [ ] The declared integration branch (`git.integrationBranch` in
      `workbench/manifest.json`, which the migration declares) exists on the
      default remote at the migration commit, or the upgrade spec
      records the explicit reason it was omitted.
